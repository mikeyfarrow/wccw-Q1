1. Add a table to your document. For example, make a table that shows
the weather forecast and the expected high and low temperature for
the next 5 days.

2. Make a list with lists inside of it. Follow the example below:
    * Simpsons
        * Bart
        * Lisa
        * Marge
    * Seinfeld
        * Jerry
        * Elaine
        * George

3. Using CSS, change the font color of all headings in your document.
(See your CSS handout for help). To accomplish this, you will need to
make a new CSS file called style.css and save it in the same folder as
your HTML file. To link your style.css file from your HTML, you will
need to add the following line of code inside the head element of your
HTML:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

4. Customize your page's style! Use the CSS handout as a guide.
