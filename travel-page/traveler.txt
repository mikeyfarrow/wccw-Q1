Puerto Escondido is known for one of the world's best surfing beaches, Playa Zicatela. It has a beautiful yellow sand beach and huge world-class surfing waves (but be careful if you go swimming...the current is very strong!).

Here is a picture of a surfer at Puerto Escondido... ¡Qué onda!

Snacks in Dublin

Eating food with the locals in Dublin this past summer made me really appreciate Ireland. The top three places in Dublin for good craic (i.e. good fun) in order of my preference are:

Davy Byrne's
Kehoe's
Long Hall
The price of a bowl of porridge is about €5. Although I would recommend the soup (around €8 a bowl).
