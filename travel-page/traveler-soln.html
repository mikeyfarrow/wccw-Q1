    <h3>Puerto Escondido: Sun, Surf, and Sand</h3>
    <p>Puerto Escondido is known for one of the world's best surfing
      beaches, Playa Zicatela.  It has a beautiful yellow sand beach
      and huge world-class surfing waves (but be careful if you go
      swimming...the current is <em>very</em> strong!).</p>
    <p>Here is a picture of a surfer at Puerto Escondido...

    <h3>Tikal: Mayan Ruins in the Guatemalan Jungle</h3>
    <p>Tikal is the largest of the ancient ruined cities of the Mayan
      civilization. It is a really awesome, magical place. 
      If you go to Tikal, you have three main lodging options:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="images/places/tikal.jpg">Tikal
        National Park</a>: Fancier hotels.</li>
      <li><a href="images/places/elremate.jpg">
        El Remate</a> (~30km away): Hotels or hostels.</li>
      <li><a href="images/places/map_of_guatemala.jpg">
        Flores</a> (~50km away): Hotels or hostels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Snacks in Dublin</h3>
    <p>Eating food with the locals in Dublin this past summer
      made me really appreciate Ireland.  The top three places in
      Dublin for good <q>craic</q> (i.e. good fun) in order of my
      preference are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Davy Byrne's</li>
      <li>Kehoe's</li>
      <li>Long Hall</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The price of a bowl of porridge is about &#8364;5.  Although I
      would recommend the soup (around &#8364;8 a bowl).</p>
